command prompt window, you pick the file you want to monitor for activity
or somehow make this into a service if you compile 1 instance of it per file that should work

it somehow monitors file access, netowrk access and wishfully the user name accessing the file

every read or write or modify is timestamped and written to a text log and the next line of the log is a large CRC 
like SHA256 checksum 
of the entire file up to the checksum, so this way you cant fake a log entry without redoing every single file checksum

this makes your file a hard target and a time consuming one to fake access log entries to, thus making detection an easier process
and to make it impossible, maybe you could monitor the log file with another instance of this program, or just build that in? that's ridiculous.
but would be officially ridiculously dificult to fake.
