# Secure-File-Access-Log-Generator


so now you can watch the watchmen who are watching the watchmen while you watch their watchmen. and since each process is so small,
i suppose you can do this like a million times if you so chose to do so. 

this could be used in an admin only VM over net shared drive, etc to monitor a particular log file for tampering or a password key 
file that you simply need to know when edits were made

maybe in the future we can figure out how to pull the user of the file. perhaps not in C# due to its inherent softness.
